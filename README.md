# 🌐 Portfolio Demo Website <br><br><br>
## 👋 About This Project <br><br>
This is my Portfolio Demo Website, a simple but powerful way to share who I am and what I’ve built. It’s made with HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP, and the goal is to keep things clean, responsive, and easy to customize. Think of it as a digital portfolio that anyone can adapt to tell their own story. <br><br>
## ✨ Highlights <br>
- Works smoothly on desktop, tablet, and mobile.<br>
- Built with PHP so forms and dynamic content actually work.<br>
- Organized structure — assets, scripts, and styles are all neatly separated.<br>
- Interactive touches with JavaScript (animations, validation, etc.).<br>
- Lightweight, fast, and easy to deploy on any PHP-friendly server.<br><br>
## 🛠️ Tech Used<br><br>
- Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript<br>
- Backend: PHP<br>
- Hosting: Localhost (XAMPP/WAMP/LAMP) or live server<br><br>
